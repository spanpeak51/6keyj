# 6keyj

## What's this?
This is the QMK config for Painless Prototyping's BYO Keyboard PCB, if used with an Arduino Pro Micro clone instead of the intended Adafruit microcontroller dev board.

Because this isn't an intended setup, it probably won't be merged into [qmk/qmk_firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware). 

## How do I use it?

If you haven't set up the QMK build environment, head [here](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/tutorial/newbs_getting_started) and do that first.

Then, clone or download this repo and copy the `6keyj` folder into `qmk_firmware/keyboards`. That's it, modify the config as desired and build/flash the firmware.
